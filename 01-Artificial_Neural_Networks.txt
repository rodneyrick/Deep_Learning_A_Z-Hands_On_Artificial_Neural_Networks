Welcome to Part 1 - Artificial Neural Networks
Section 2, Lecture 5

In this part you will learn:

    1. the Intuition of ANNs
    2. how to build an ANN
    3. how to predict the outcome of a single observation (Homework Challenge)
    4. how to evaluate the performance of an ANN with k-Fold Cross Validation
    5. how to tackle overfitting with Dropout
    6. how to do some Parameter Tuning on your ANN to improve its performance

Enjoy Deep Learning!
