Welcome to Part 6 - AutoEncoders



In this part you will learn:

    1. the Intuition of AutoEncoders
    2. how to build an AutoEncoder from scratch with PyTorch
    3. how to manipulate classes and objects to improve and tune your AutoEncoder

In the previous part we created a Recommender System that predicted binary ratings "Like" or "Not Like". In this part we will take it at the next level and create a Recommender System that predicts ratings from 1 to 5.
