Annex - Get the Machine Learning Basics
Section 28, Lecture 161
Hi guys,

in this part you will find all the Machine Learning basics you need to have a proper understanding of this Deep Learning A-Z course. We highly recommend that you have a look at our Data Preprocessing Template and Classification Template before you start the practical activities in Python. Of course, if you already completed Parts 1, 2 and 3 in our Machine Learning A-Z course, this Annex part is not necessary.

This Annex part is composed of three sections:

    1. Regression & Classification Intuition - with Intuition Lectures about Regression and Classification
    2. Data Preprocessing Template - with the Step-By-Step Implementation of the Data Preprocessing phase
    3. Classification Template - with the Step-By-Step Implementation of our Classification template
    
Enjoy Deep Learning!
