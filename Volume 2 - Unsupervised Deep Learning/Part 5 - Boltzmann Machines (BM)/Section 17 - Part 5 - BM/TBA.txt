Section 22, Lecture 106
Welcome to Part 5 - Boltzmann Machines

In this part you will learn:

 1. the Intuition of Boltzmann Machines
 2. how to build a Boltzmann Machine

Boltzmann Machines can be seen from two different points of view:

 1. An Energy-Based Model
 1. A Probabilistic Graphical Model

In the Intuition Lectures Kirill will focus more on the Energy-Based Model point of view, and then for the Practical Lectures we will focus more on the Probabilistic Graphical Model point of view.

In these last two parts (Part 5 - Boltzmann Machines and Part 6 - AutoEncoders) of this course, we will create two types of Recommender Systems:

 1. One that predicts binary ratings "Like" or "Not Like". We will build it in this Part 5 with a Boltzmann Machine.
 2. Another one that predicts ratings from 1 to 5. We will build it in Part 6 with an AutoEncoder.

Enjoy Deep Learning!
